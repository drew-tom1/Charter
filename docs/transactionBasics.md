# Basics of Transactions

In this application, we will be using a modified and simplified version of the credit/debit accounting system for the transaction ledger. Each of the transaction types will be listed below.

### Credits:

- Represents money flowing out of an account
- Increases liability, equity, and revenue accounts
- Decreases asset and expense accounts

### Debits:

- Represents money flowing into an account
- Increase asset and expense accounts.
- Decrease liability, equity, and revenue accounts.

In terms of chapter funds, we will be using CREDITS for reimbursements and expensing events, and DEBITS for things such as dues collection, fundraising, etc.

That means that all credits should be marked as deductions from the central chapter account and all debits should be marked as additions to the central chapter account.
